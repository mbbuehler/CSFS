Dear

We are using the adult dataset for a crowd sourcing experiment. Not all meanings for the features are clear to me from the dataset description. Would you drop me a few quick lines and answer the following questions?

i) What is the meaning of capital-gain / -loss? How was it measured?
ii) What is the difference between "Married-civ-spouse" and "Married-AF-spouse"?
iii) How can the variable "relationship" be interpreted? What is its relation to marital-status?
iv) What does "Assoc-acdm" and "Assoc-voc" mean?

I appreciate your help very much!

Best,

Marcel
