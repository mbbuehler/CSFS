Charlotte loves gossiping with her friends. One day when drinking coffee with her best friend Tracy, she wonders what might be necessary to know about a person in order to predict his/her income. Charlotte decides to build a classifier in order to predict whether a person working in the USA earns more or less than $50,000 per year (binary target variable: YES if a person earns more than $50,000 per year and NO if a person earns less than $50,000 per year). \\

Understandably, no classifier will be able to predict very well with little information. Charlotte therefore came up with a few potential features she could use. Before going through the hassle of getting data for these potential features, cleaning it, etc., she turns to you. She would like you to rank these potential features based on how much you expect them to increase classifier performance. Using your ranking, Charlotte will acquire data for your highest ranked feature first, followed by the second, etc. \\

All of Charlotte's feature ideas are binary, this means that they can either be true or false. Note, that numeric variables can easily be transformed into binary variables by binning them. For example, the variable "age" can be binned into the binary variables "younger than 17", "between 17 and 41 years", "older than 41" at some information loss. In that case, we treat each bin as an individual feature, since some bins might be more valuable to Charlotte's classifier than others. Also note that categorical variables can easily be transformed into binary variables through dummy extraction. In this case, we also treat all arising dummies as separate features. \\

Please help Charlotte and rank the list of potential features by relevancy. The element on the top of the list should promise the largest improvement to the classifier, the second one should see the second highest improvement in classifier performance, etc...
