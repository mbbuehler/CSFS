Your friend Charlotte is taking an online course in data science. As an exercise, she wants to predict whether a person working in the USA earns more than $50,000 per year given US Census data about this person.
Charlotte claims herself a very efficient person. Instead of collecting a high number of mostly non-relevant features, she wants to build a classifier with as few features as possible. Before collecting any data, she wants to filter out as many features as possible.
She already removed many of her original feature ideas. There are 17 feature ideas left. Charlotte is not sure which ones she should keep. Therefore, she turns to you for help. She asks you to rank the features bellow in descending order. The most relevant feature should be on top, the least relevant feature on the bottom.
