Charlotte loves gossiping with her friends. One day when drinking coffee with her best friend Tracy, she wonders what might be necessary to know about a person in order to predict his/her income. Specifically, she would like to find out what aspects about a person are relevant in order to predict whether that person earns more than $50,000 per year or less than that.\\
In an intensive brainstorming session, Charlotte and Tracy collect 17 ideas. Now they are not sure which ones are actually relevant. They turn to you for help and ask you to rank their ideas according.\\
Please help Charlotte and Tracy with their task and order the ideas bellow. The most relevant aspect should be on top, the least relevant aspect on the bottom.
