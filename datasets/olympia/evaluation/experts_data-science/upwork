Your friend Tom is big gambler as well as a sports lover. He loves betting with his friends and he had an idea for a new challenge: Betting on which countries will win a gold medal at the next olympics.\\
In order to increase his chances of winning, he wants to build a classifier. For each country, he has already collected its name and whether it won at least one gold medal at the last olympics (target variable). Understandably, no classifier will be able to predict very well with so little information. Tom therefore came up with a few more features he could use. Before going ahead with implementing his ideas, Tom turns to you. He would like you to rank his feature ideas based on how likely you think they increase classifier performance.
Please help Tom and rank the given features in descending order. The most relevant features should be on top, the least relevant features on the bottom.
