Your friend Tom is big gambler as well as a sports lover. He loves betting with his friends and he recently had an idea for a new challenge: Betting on which countries will win a gold medal at the next olympics.\\
Tom is convinced that certain aspects of a country (e.g. in what part of the world it is located or how much electricity it consumes) can help predict whether a country will win a gold medal or not. He already came up with some ideas. At the moment, he is just not sure, which aspects are relevant and which ones aren't. Tom therefore asks you for help. He would like you to rank his ideas based on how relevant you think they are to predict whether a country will win a gold medal in the next olympics.\\
Please help Tom and rank the given aspects in descending order. The most relevant aspect should be on top, the least relevant aspect on the bottom.
