Your friend Richard would like to build a classifier to predict whether a high school student's final grade in a language subject is among the better half of the class. For each high school student, he has data for a few features already (age, name) as well as the target variable (better or equal than 50% yes/no). Understandably, using these 2 features, no classifier will be able to predict the target variable very well. Richard therefore came up with a few ideas for features he could use, but each of them will cost money, since Richard (or someone he knows) will need to survey the enlisted students. Before going ahead with implementing his ideas, Richard therefore turns to you. He asks you to rank his feature ideas based on their cost and how likely you think they increase classifier performance.
Please help Richard and rank the given feature ideas by what data you'd recommend him to get first (= top in list), what second (2nd in list) etc, taking into account the cost of a feature and how much you expect Richard's classifier to improve. 

All of Richard's feature ideas are binary, this means that they can either be true or false. Note, that numeric variables can easily be transformed into binary variables through binning them (e.g. the variable "student age" can be binned into the binary variables "age is 11", "age is 12".., "age is 19" ). Some bins might be more valuable to Richard's classifier than others. For the sake of the experiment, each bin has separate cost. That is, "age is 11" costs as much as "age is 12". If "age is 11" is bought, one would still need to buy "age is 12", since Richard can only deal with binary features. 

When ranking the variables, please take their cost into account, as well as how much you think they improve the classifier (i.e., their value).
