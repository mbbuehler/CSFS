Your friend Richard is an experienced high school teacher. He claims that only by knowing a few key aspects about the student (for example, the age of the student), he can predict how well a student will be performing compared to the rest of the class. More specifically, he claims that he can predict whether a student's final grade will be among the better half of the class or among the worse half. He's just not entirely sure what aspects to use for his prediction. Therefore, Richard and you brainstorm aspects that are possibly relevant. Together, you come up with 15 different aspects. Richard then asks you for your opinion about the relevance of each aspect. He would like you to rank all of these 15 aspects in the order you think depicts their relevancy. For example, if you think age is the most relevant of the full list, you'd rank it to the top, followed by the second most influential aspect etc. \\
Below you find a (randomly ordered) list with aspects. Please rank them. Your answer will be compared to the actual relevancy of the aspects and the best answer will receive a bonus.
