Deine Freundin Lea 


"Your friend Barack would like to build a classifier to predict whether a high school students final grade is among the better half of the class. For each high school 



student, he has a few features already (age, name) and the target variable (better or equal than 50% yes/no). Understandably, using these 2 features, no classifier will be able to predict very well. Barack therefore came up with a few more features he could use, but each of them will cost money, since Barack (or someone he knows) will need to survey the enlisted students. Before going ahead with implementing his ideas, Barack therefore turns to you, to rank his feature ideas based on their cost and how likely you think they increase classifier performance.
Please help Barack and rank the given aspects in descending order. The most relevant aspect should be on top, the least relevant aspect on the bottom."
